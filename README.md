## Introduction
School Records Management System (SRMS) is a relational database project aimed at digitizing and automating the storage, retrieval, and management of school-related information. 
This project is designed to replace the manual systems with a more reliable, efficient, and scalable solution.

The project uses a combination of SQL (for database development) and sample dummy data for testing and analysis. 
The database can later be extended to connect with front-end applications (web or mobile).

## Project Overview

Smart School Academy is a mid-sized secondary school in a growing urban area. The school is facing difficulties managing student records, teacher information, course schedules, and performance reports. 
Currently, the school relies on spreadsheets and paper-based filing systems, which are prone to errors, difficult to update, and impossible to scale.

Challenges faced:

- Records get lost or duplicated.

- Teachers' schedules and subjects are mismatched.

- It's hard to generate reports on student performance.

- Parent-teacher communication is inconsistent due to poor data access.

- Enrollment and course assignment processes are slow and prone to mismanagement.
